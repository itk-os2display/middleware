# os2display/middleware

## 6.0.0

* Added dashboard.
* Updated modules.

**NB! This update requires reloading the screens after the middleware has been updated. Otherwise, the screen and the middleware will run different versions of the socket.io code, which will result in broken connections.**

## 5.0.2

* Added call to get present channels in middleware for a backend.
